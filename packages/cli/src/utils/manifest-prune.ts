/**
 * Self-heal poisoned `.template-hashes.json` manifests.
 *
 * Versions before this fix walked `.codex/`, `.claude/`, etc. with a blind
 * recursive scan when computing the manifest, so they hashed user-owned
 * runtime data (`.codex/sessions/*`, `.claude/projects/*.jsonl`, pre-existing
 * `AGENTS.md`, user-added `.codex/skills/<custom>/`, …). On uninstall, every
 * manifest entry is unlinked, which silently deletes user data.
 *
 * `pruneOrphanManifestKeys` removes any manifest entry that no current
 * platform configurator owns. The two entry points that consume it are
 * `suncode update` (before migration classification) and `suncode uninstall`
 * (before plan building). Together they ensure existing poisoned manifests
 * self-correct on the next routine command.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - `.trellis/*` entries are ALWAYS kept. `suncode uninstall` removes
 *     `.trellis/` wholesale via `fs.rmSync(..., { recursive: true })`, so
 *     manifest accuracy there doesn't affect uninstall data-loss. `update`
 *     also relies on these entries to detect user-modified workflow files.
 *   - Root-level `AGENTS.md` is kept only when it still looks Suncode-managed
 *     (contains the managed block markers) or is missing on disk. This
 *     self-heals old poisoned manifests for user-owned AGENTS.md files that
 *     predated init and were skipped.
 *   - Paths referenced by `from`/`to` of any migration manifest entry
 *     (rename, rename-dir, delete, safe-file-delete) are preserved. Pruning
 *     them would prevent legitimate pending migrations from finding their
 *     source/target.
 *   - Everything else: if the path is not in the union of
 *     `collectPlatformTemplates()` for currently-configured platforms, it is
 *     pruned. This matches "files trellis actually wrote during init/update".
