/**
 * Pre-release gate: ensure migration-manifest continuity with npm.
 *
 * Contract: once a version is published to npm, its manifest is part of the
 * public update contract. `trellis update` applies manifests where
 * `v > installed && v <= current` — if any published version is missing a
 * local manifest, users upgrading from that version silently skip their
 * bucket of migrations.
 *
 * This guard runs before `pnpm version` bumps on every release track:
 *   1. Query npm for all published versions of @wjptz/suncode
 *   2. Diff against local `src/migrations/manifests/*.json`
 *   3. Fail non-zero if any npm version lacks a local manifest
 *
 * Historical gaps (existed before this check was introduced) are listed in
 * KNOWN_GAPS below so the gate can block *new* drift without being stuck
 * on accumulated debt. Do NOT add to KNOWN_GAPS — fix the root cause instead.
 *
 * Override: `SKIP_MANIFEST_CONTINUITY=1` to bypass (for emergency re-rolls
 * that knowingly accept the tradeoff). Prints a loud banner when bypassed.
 *
 * Background:
 *   The beta.10 incident (manifest deleted from repo AFTER being published
 *   to npm) motivated this gate — see .trellis/spec/cli/backend/migrations.md.
